#DTMF ASCII Encoder for Arduino
Overview
This Arduino project facilitates the encoding and decoding of the entire ASCII table (256 characters) into DTMF (Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency) tones. It's ideal for wireless or audio-based data transmission where using the DTMF system is required or preferred.

#Features
Full ASCII Support: Each ASCII character is encoded into a unique pair of DTMF tones.
Flexible Transmission Methods: Supports various transmission mediums like audio signals, radio links, etc.
Easy Integration: Designed for easy integration into existing Arduino projects.
Error Detection: Optional integrated mechanisms for detecting and correcting transmission errors.

#How it Works
Each ASCII character is encoded into a pair of DTMF tones. The mapping is done in two steps:

The first tone is determined by the quotient of dividing the ASCII value by 16.
The second tone is determined by the remainder (modulo) of dividing the ASCII value by 16.

#Installation
Clone the repository and import the library into your Arduino IDE.
```git clone https://github.com/bastelgarage/ascii2dmtf.git```

#Example
A simple example of how to encode an ASCII character and then decode it:
```#include "DTMF_ASCII.h"

void setup() {
  // Initialization
}

void loop() {
  char ascii_char = 'A'; // ASCII character to encode
  DTMF_TonePair tones = encode_to_dtmf(ascii_char); // Encoding
  char decoded_char = decode_from_dtmf(tones); // Decoding
}
```
